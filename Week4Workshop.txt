Q1) You are building a web app that uses Express.js and you want to log all the
incoming requests in a short format automatically. What are the steps to do that?

You are not supposed to write the full source code
Support your steps with commands or statments:




ANSWER:

Code in the terminal:

	npm install morgan 

Code the morgan:

	let morgan = require('morgan');
	app.use(morgan('short'));





Q2) What are the differences between res.sendFile() and res.render()?
Support your answer with examples

res.sendFile('index.html');  
res.render('index' , {
		username: "Tim"
});


ANSWER:

The difference is that the render works when we have a templating engine in the html
file and generate and output. While the sendFile will just send the html file to view the
content to the user

res.sendFile('index.html');  // takes one parameter the html file name
res.render('index.html' , {
		username: "Tim"
}); // takes the html file and the data I wanna send to the html file
and <%= username > should be added to the html file when using the render





Q3) Using the Node.js and Express, develop a web app (server side only) that has the
ability to:

- render HTML files
- serve static assets in a directory named 'public'
- Respond with a string contains the current date for any request with pathname
	='/getdate'
- Respond with a string contains the current Time for any request with pathname
	='/getTime'

ANSWER:


let express = require('express');
let app = express();
let morgan = require('morgan');
let date = new Date();



app.use(express.static('public');

app.get('/getdate', function(req,res){

	res.render('index.html' , { date: date.getDate()})

});

app.get('/getTime', function(req,res){

	res.render('index.html' , { date: date.getTime()})

});

app.listen(8080);
