Q1) 

	a- MongoDB is a document database. What are the 'document' and 'collection'
		in MongoDB?
	b- MongoDB document is not a JSON object. Elaborate this statment.


ANSWER:

a- Collection is like a table in relational DB but table have rows and column 
	but here we have different structure so we call it a collection. 
	While each row is a document.

In other words:

Collection: is set of documents
Document: is a data structure composed of field and value pairs.


b- It is similar to JSON, but it is bigger because JSON only contains of primitive 
	datatypes. While here it have more features than a JSON object. It may include
	the primitive data types, and other data types such as dates, timestamp
	,regular expressions and binrary data, More over it can include 
	other documents, arrays , and arrays of documents.




Q2)

	Assume: 
	db- a ref to a database
	flights- is a collection with the following fields: flightDate, from, to, ariline
		, and cost.

	Write full Mongo statments:
		1. Find all the flights with 'Va' airline
		2. Find a flight between SA and SYD (from)
		3. Double the cost of flights between 'SYD' and 'NT' (from)
		4. Delete all the flights with cost less than 300

callback body leave blank

ANSWER:

1. Find all the flights with 'VA' airline:

app.get('/getAllVA',function(req,res){
	let query = {airline:"VA"};
	flights.find(query).toArray(function(err,data){
		
		res.send(data);
	});
});

2. Find a flight between 'SA' and 'SYD':

app.get('/getBetween',function(req,res){
	let query = {$and [{from:"SA"}, {to: "SYD"}]};
	flights.find(query).toArray(function(err,data){
		res.send(data);
	});
});


3. Double the cost of flights between 'SYD' and 'NT':

app.get('/updateFlight',function(req,res){

	flights.updateMany({$and [{from:"SYD"}, {to: "NT"}]},{$mul: {cost: 2 } }, {upsert: false},
	 (function(err,data){
		res.send(data);
	});

});



4. Delete all the flights with cost less than 300:


app.get('/deleteFlight',function(req,res){
	let query = {cost:{$lt: 300}};
	flights.deleteMany(query, (function(err,data){
		res.send(data);
	});
});






Q3) Using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, write a server side code that handles the forms's
	request and inserts a document into a collection named 'flights' in a database
	name 'travel' which is hosted by a machine with IP= '42.128.78.49' and listens to
	port 55312.

ANSWER:

let express = require('express');
let app = express();
let mongodb = require('mongodb');
let mongodbClient = mongodb.MongoClient;
let url = "mongodb://42.128.78.49:55312";
let db = null;
let col = null;
let viewsPath = __dirname + '/views/';
let bodyParser = require('body-parser');

app.use(bodyParser.urlecnoded({ extended:false }));

mongodbClient.connect(url,{useNewUrlParser: true} ,function(err ,client){
	db= client.db('travel');
	col = db.collection('flights');

});

app.get('/', function(req,res){
	res.sendFile(viewsPath + 'index.html');
});

app.post('/bookingpost', function(req,res){
	col.inserOne(req.body);
	res.sendFile(viewsPath + 'index.html');
});

app.listen(8080);
