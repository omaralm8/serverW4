Notes:

npm init
npm install mongoose

Q1)

	1. List three advantages of using Mongoose to manage MongoDB database.
	2. Briefly describe what is Object-relational mapping (ORM)?



Answer:

1. 
	a- Mongoose provides schema where we can define a data types
	b- Mongoose allow you to have data validation
	c- Mongoose allow you to have data pre processing

2. it is a way for converting the data between incompatible type systems using object
	oriented.




Q2) Write a schema that meets the following specs:

	- Has fields: _id, from, to, airline, cost.
	- from, to, and airline are strings and requried fields
	- The defualt value of from is 'Sydney'
	- cost should always be positive


Answer:

let airlineSchema = mongoose.schema({
	
	
	to:{
		type:String, 
		required: true
	},
	airline:{
		type:String,
		required: true
	},
	cost:{
		type:Number,
		min:0
	},
	created:{
		type:String,
		default: "Sydney"
	}
});



Q3) Assume the following:

	- you have a database name 'Travel' hosted in a machine with IP= '128.0.15.66' with
		port = 886655

	- You have implemented a schema in a file named 'travelschema.js' that represents a
		collection with five fields: _id, from, to, airline, and cost.


Answer:

let mongoose= require('mongoose');
let url="mongodb://128.0.15.66:886655/Travel";
let Flight = require('./models/travelschema'

mongoose.connect(url, function(err){
	if(err){
		console.log(err);
	}
	else{
		let flight = new Flight({
			from: 'MEL',
			to: 'JNB',
			airline: 'VA',
			cost: 2500
		});
		
		flight.save(function(err)({
			
			if(err){
				console.log(err);
			}
			else{
				console.log('Saved!!!'); 
			}
		});
	}
});
